# Abduct-Me

Abduct-Me is an "interactive" app I developed for users with an interest in aliens and/or science fiction. I developed this app with the intention of just having fun and to make it seem like you're actually booking a trip (Alien Abduction).

## Technologies Used:

* Mongoose
* MongoDB
* React
* Javascript
* Node.js
* CSS
* [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/94vgBiV0/abduct "trello link")

### Getting Started

[Try Abduct-Me Here](https://abduct-me-970d34075b0d.herokuapp.com/ "app link")

1. Logging in / Signing up will be the first page a user can interact with when rendering the app. You must fill out the data for sign up to access the site as a new user. After signing up, you can just use the email and password for logging in for future forms. Once logged in, you are now authenticated for use in the app.

2. Starting your form is able for use by clicking the link at the top of the screen. Once clicked, the page will render the abduction form where you can fill out your booking. Be sure to fill out the form with your Name, Email, Phone Number, Requested Date, UFO type, and your Abduction Experience option. If you wish to start over, feel free to hit the cancel button.

3. "Booking History" is the page that will be rendered after submitting your form to the database. There you will see a small version or a card showing some of your filled out data from your submitted form. The more forms you submit the more cards will show on this page!

4. Editing your form is as easy as pressing the "Update" button on your "Booking History" page! After pressing that button you will then load the Edit Abduction page. You can see the data you filled out from the form already preloaded in the form. Feel free to change or add things you wish you didn't forget the first time.

5. Logging out can be done at anytime. By moving your mouse to the top of the screen and clicking the "Log Out" link in the navigation bar. Clicking this link will render the Authentication Page again, where you can signup as a new user or decide to log back in if you change your mind.

#### Next Steps:

* As a developer, I feel my site can benefit from more styling.

* As a developer, I want a "receipt" to be sent to my email after submitting my abduction form "https://www.emailjs.com/".

* As a developer, I want to choose my pilot for my booking by using a word to describe him "robohash.org".

* As a developer, I would like to see pictures on my form of my ship choices/activites.

* As a developer, I would like to use this app on mobile as well as desktop.

* As a developer, it would be nice to pick my "beam up" location (location api?).

* As a developer, I would like to see a home page when im logged in or signed up with details about my site.
